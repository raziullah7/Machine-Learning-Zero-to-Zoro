Coding Exercise 4: Dataset Splitting and Feature Scaling

1: Import necessary Python libraries: pandas, train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection, and StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing.

2: Load the Iris dataset using Pandas read.csv. Dataset name is iris.csv.

3: Use train_test_split to split the dataset into an 80-20 training-test set.

4: Apply random_state with 42 value in train_test_split function for reproducible results.

5: Print X_train, X_test, Y_train, and Y_test to understand the dataset split.

6: Use StandardScaler to apply feature scaling on the training and test sets.

7: Print scaled training and test sets to verify feature scaling.
